# Iris-Flower-Classification
Iris flower classification

This code is a simple machine learning program that uses the Iris dataset to train and predict species using linear regression and decision tree classifier.

The code starts by importing necessary libraries and reading the Iris dataset into a Pandas dataframe.

The data is then visualized using various Plotly charts, such as scatter plots and bar charts. 

The data is then preprocessed, which includes label encoding the target variable and splitting the data into training and testing sets. 

The linear regression model is then trained on the training data and used to make predictions on the test data. 

The accuracy of the model is calculated using the accuracy_score function from the scikit-learn library. 

Finally, a line graph is plotted to compare the actual test data and the predicted data. 

The code then repeats the process using decision tree classifier instead of linear regression and compares the results.
